This is a fully functional eCommerce store that uses Next.js + Tailwind CSS in the front end and leverages the Shopify Storefront API to interact with your Shopify backend. You can see a Live Demo [here](https://doggystickers.vercel.app/ "Shopify store").

We use GraphQL to query our Shopify data and store the cart information in localStorage to persist user session. Finally - we use Shopify Checkout to let the user
purchase the items. You can see this play out in the example store. Yes - the store is functional and you can buy the stickers. :smiley:
